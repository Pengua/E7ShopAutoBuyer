# E7ShopAutoBuyer

Epic Seven Secret shop auto refresh and bookmark purchaser. Uses OCR to read the item name and buys both types of bookmarks that show up. 

I made this script for myself after learning AutoHotkey in a day so it's pretty barebones.

Everything is coded via absolute locations so good luck if you don't have the same window sizes as me.

# Requirements:
- Enough gold to buy the bookmarks
- Enough SS to refresh
- Bluestacks running at 1600x900
- 1920x1080 screen

# HOW TO:
1. Install AutoHotkey (https://www.autohotkey.com/)
2. Download the .AHK file "E7ShopBMAutobuyer.ahk" (https://github.com/Pengua/E7ShopAutoBuyer/releases/tag/V1.1) 
3. Run the .AHK file (You should see the green 'H' in your system tray)
4. Enter Garo's Secret Shop
5. CTRL+ALT+S to run the script. (The emulator will auto-center on your screen)
6. ESC to stop the script.

## Notes:
- The script loops only 50 times, but is really easy to change.
- OCR is very accurate, just watch the script yourself if you don't trust it.
- It shouldn't work on other resolutions because I'm too lazy to make it work that way, also I can't be bothered to figure it out. I'm sure someone else can.
- Using a different emulator should be ok, but I only tested on Bluestacks 5

## Warnings:

The delays are hard coded, meaning if there are server issues (Running Ras) or your Bluestacks is slower, the script will probably run into problems. I run it on my laptop with 64bit Bluestacks 5. I'd suggest coding in a multiplier for the sleep delays if you're worried about it.
